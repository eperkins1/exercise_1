Overall, I find that hospital scores are negatively correlated with survey response scores.

Results:

Correlation between average total_score (which is equal to the average of timely and effective care scores times the average of complications, readmissions and deaths scores for hospitals with large enough samples) and survey resultsare as follows:

Overall achievement: -0.01749052844951342	
Hcahps base score: -0.37566559831957086	
Hcahps consistency score: -0.19049679094203648 

Correlations between average timely and effective care score and survey results are:

Overall achievement: -0.09289018778561325	
Hcahps base score: -0.2920312460716303
Hcahps consistency score: -0.294694495770566

Correlations between average complications, readmissions and deaths scores and survey results are:

Overall achievement: 0.007903633934134907	
Hcahps base score: -0.33638942857702175
Hcahps consistency score: -0.11959063234558666

This is a very puzzling, counterintuitive result that has several possible explanations. One explanation is that my assumption that higher scores are better for most hospital measures is flawed. If, for a sufficient number of measures, higher scores are indications of worse performance, then the results would make much more sense. Another explanation is that in my selection of hospitals, I filtered out too much data by requiring a sample of 100 in computing average scores.
